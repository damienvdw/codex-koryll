**Scheming Bureaucrat 139**

“They say a lucky man waits for his ship to come in. Mine comes in twice or three times daily, and each one must pay for the right to load and unload cargo on my dock. That's how you get rich quick.”

**Appearance :**  In his thirties, Abel abstains from rum, and he's been rewarded with good health. He prefers to wear a stiff coat with rows of fancy buttons, bright tights and buckled shoes. A tricorn hat rests atop his powered wig.

**Roleplaying :** He sniffs the air indignantly at anyone who scoffs at the high fees he charges. 

**Personality :** Abel has a plan, and so far, he's stuck with it. He's astute at working the system of bureaucracy to his advantage by gleaning a portion of the dock fees for himself. But he's growing impatient for his investments in privateers to pay off in a big way.

**Motivation :** He wants to get rich and live like a gentleman— especially in a place far, far from here.

**Background :** Born in the colonies, Abel wheedled his way into an apprenticeship with the previous dockmaster. He's accumulating a fortune by charging docking fees and by investing in the cleverest and boldest privateer captains. With bribes to key officials, he's maintained his posting over the objections of the ship owners. Keeping informed about privateer prize ships has enabled him to stay abreast of news.

**Traits :** (TT) Business, power hungry
